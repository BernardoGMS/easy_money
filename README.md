The goal of this project is to complement programming practices with a scenario close to
 the reality of the Data Science profession, in which the requirements are poorly (or not at
 all) defined, and to provide data science solutions in an area of analytical marketing and
 business development.
 
 Task 1: Data Analysis: It starts from the dataset provided for the development of data of
 EasyMoney. The objective is to analyze and explore the data we have from a statistical and
 business perspective, to obtain an adequate business vision and in the future be able
 to face the entrusted tasks.
 Task 1 b : Dashboard: The direct result of this task is the obtaining of a BI tool (Dashboard)
 that will be used to interactively explore all the visualizations and information provided
 below.
 
 Task 2: Segmentation: After the analysis, the segmentation of EasyMoney
 customers is explore  with the aim of guiding the company's commercial activity and helping to define
 a marketing plan based on the analysis of existing data.
 
 Task 3: Recommendation: Helping the marketing team to understand the “ball of the
 future” (expected ROIs are of interest) and help them understand the response rate before
 sending the 10,000 emails. Proposed idea from marketing team: To be able to send to the customers the product that
 interests them the most (and the one that helps us earn more). Revenue is approximately
 €10 for each account sold, €40 for savings and investment products (plans, funds, etc.) and
 €60 for financing products (loans and cards).
 
 Task 4: Monitoring: In this task it was proposed some KPIs to monitor the marketing campaign
 to follow up the process and understand if the feedback from the customers are according
 to our expectations.
 
 Task 5: Coordination: At last, it was created a project plan for each phase of
 the project, and for that purpose, the kanban-style was used, list-making application Trello to
 coordinate the project as well as the timings and tasks.
